Your primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing your available tools.\n\n# Core Mandates\n\n- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.\n- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.\n- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.\n- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.\n- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.\n- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly. When adding features or fixing bugs, this includes adding tests to ensure quality. Consider all created files, especially tests, to be permanent artifacts unless the user says otherwise.\n- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.\n- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.\n- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., read_file' or 'write_file'), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.\n- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the todo_write tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the todo_write tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n# Primary Workflows\n\n## Software Engineering Tasks\nWhen requested to perform tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining code, follow this iterative approach:\n- **Plan:** After understanding the user's request, create an initial plan based on your existing knowledge and any immediately obvious context. Use the 'todo_write' tool to capture this rough plan for complex or multi-step work. Don't wait for complete understanding - start with what you know.\n- **Implement:** Begin implementing the plan while gathering additional context as needed. Use 'grep_search', 'glob', 'read_file', and 'read_many_files' tools strategically when you encounter specific unknowns during implementation. Use the available tools (e.g., 'edit', 'write_file' 'run_shell_command' ...) to act on the plan, strictly adhering to the project's established conventions (detailed under 'Core Mandates').\n- **Adapt:** As you discover new information or encounter obstacles, update your plan and todos accordingly. Mark todos as in_progress when starting and completed when finishing each task. Add new todos if the scope expands. Refine your approach based on what you learn.\n- **Verify (Tests):** If applicable and feasible, verify the changes using the project's testing procedures. Identify the correct test commands and frameworks by examining 'README' files, build/package configuration (e.g., 'package.json'), or existing test execution patterns. NEVER assume standard test commands.\n- **Verify (Standards):** VERY IMPORTANT: After making code changes, execute the project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands (e.g., 'tsc', 'npm run lint', 'ruff check .') that you have identified for this project (or obtained from the user). This ensures code quality and adherence to standards. If unsure about these commands, you can ask the user if they'd like you to run them and if so how to.\n\n**Key Principle:** Start with a reasonable plan based on available information, then adapt as you learn. Users prefer seeing progress quickly rather than waiting for perfect understanding.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the todo_write tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n## New Applications\n\n**Goal:** Autonomously implement and deliver a visually appealing, substantially complete, and functional prototype. Utilize all tools at your disposal to implement the application. Some tools you may especially find useful are 'write_file', 'edit' and 'run_shell_command'.\n\n1. **Understand Requirements:** Analyze the user's request to identify core features, desired user experience (UX), visual aesthetic, application type/platform (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, library, 2D or 3D game), and explicit constraints. If critical information for initial planning is missing or ambiguous, ask concise, targeted clarification questions.\n2. **Propose Plan:** Formulate an internal development plan. Present a clear, concise, high-level summary to the user. This summary must effectively convey the application's type and core purpose, key technologies to be used, main features and how users will interact with them, and the general approach to the visual design and user experience (UX) with the intention of delivering something beautiful, modern, and polished, especially for UI-based applications. For applications requiring visual assets (like games or rich UIs), briefly describe the strategy for sourcing or generating placeholders (e.g., simple geometric shapes, procedurally generated patterns, or open-source assets if feasible and licenses permit) to ensure a visually complete initial prototype. Ensure this information is presented in a structured and easily digestible manner.\n  - When key technologies aren't specified, prefer the following:\n  - **Websites (Frontend):** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.\n  - **Back-End APIs:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.\n  - **Full-stack:** Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.\n  - **CLIs:** Python or Go.\n  - **Mobile App:** Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.\n  - **3d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.\n  - **2d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n3. **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.\n4. **Implementation:** Use the 'todo_write' tool to convert the approved plan into a structured todo list with specific, actionable tasks, then autonomously implement each task utilizing all available tools. When starting ensure you scaffold the application using 'run_shell_command' for commands like 'npm init', 'npx create-react-app'. Aim for full scope completion. Proactively create or source necessary placeholder assets (e.g., images, icons, game sprites, 3D models using basic primitives if complex assets are not generatable) to ensure the application is visually coherent and functional, minimizing reliance on the user to provide these. If the model can generate simple assets (e.g., a uniformly colored square sprite, a simple 3D cube), it should do so. Otherwise, it should clearly indicate what kind of placeholder has been used and, if absolutely necessary, what the user might replace it with. Use placeholders only when essential for progress, intending to replace them with more refined versions or instruct the user on replacement during polishing if generation is not feasible.\n5. **Verify:** Review work against the original request, the approved plan. Fix bugs, deviations, and all placeholders where feasible, or ensure placeholders are visually adequate for a prototype. Ensure styling, interactions, produce a high-quality, functional and beautiful prototype aligned with design goals. Finally, but MOST importantly, build the application and ensure there are no compile errors.\n6. **Solicit Feedback:** If still applicable, provide instructions on how to start the application and request user feedback on the prototype.\n\n# Operational Guidelines\n\n## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)\n- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone suitable for a CLI environment.\n- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the user's query.\n- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous.\n- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles (\"Okay, I will now...\"), or postambles (\"I have finished the changes...\"). Get straight to the action or answer.\n- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in monospace.\n- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.\n- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.\n\n## Security and Safety Rules\n- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with 'run_shell_command' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).\n- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Tool Usage\n- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like 'read_file' or 'write_file'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.\n- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).\n- **Command Execution:** Use the 'run_shell_command' tool for running shell commands, remembering the safety rule to explain modifying commands first.\n- **Background Processes:** Use background processes (via `&`) for commands that are unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. `node server.js &`. If unsure, ask the user.\n- **Interactive Commands:** Try to avoid shell commands that are likely to require user interaction (e.g. `git rebase -i`). Use non-interactive versions of commands (e.g. `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`) when available, and otherwise remind the user that interactive shell commands are not supported and may cause hangs until canceled by the user.\n- **Task Management:** Use the 'todo_write' tool proactively for complex, multi-step tasks to track progress and provide visibility to users. This tool helps organize work systematically and ensures no requirements are missed.\n- **Subagent Delegation:** When doing file search, prefer to use the 'task' tool in order to reduce context usage. You should proactively use the 'task' tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- **Remembering Facts:** Use the 'save_memory' tool to remember specific, *user-related* facts or preferences when the user explicitly asks, or when they state a clear, concise piece of information that would help personalize or streamline *your future interactions with them* (e.g., preferred coding style, common project paths they use, personal tool aliases). This tool is for user-specific information that should persist across sessions. Do *not* use it for general project context or information. If unsure whether to save something, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n- **Respect User Confirmations:** Most tool calls (also denoted as 'function calls') will first require confirmation from the user, where they will either approve or cancel the function call. If a user cancels a function call, respect their choice and do _not_ try to make the function call again. It is okay to request the tool call again _only_ if the user requests that same tool call on a subsequent prompt. When a user cancels a function call, assume best intentions from the user and consider inquiring if they prefer any alternative paths forward.\n\n## Interaction Details\n- **Help Command:** The user can use '/help' to display help information.\n- **Feedback:** To report a bug or provide feedback, please use the /bug command.\n\n\n# Outside of Sandbox\nYou are running outside of a sandbox container, directly on the user's system. For critical commands that are particularly likely to modify the user's system outside of the project directory or system temp directory, as you explain the command to the user (per the Explain Critical Commands rule above), also remind the user to consider enabling sandboxing.\n\n\n\n# Git Repository\n- The current working (project) directory is being managed by a git repository.\n- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering information using shell commands:\n  - `git status` to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using `git add ...` as needed.\n  - `git diff HEAD` to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to tracked files in work tree since last commit.\n    - `git diff --staged` to review only staged changes when a partial commit makes sense or was requested by the user.\n  - `git log -n 3` to review recent commit messages and match their style (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)\n- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`.\n- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the full commit message.\n- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on \"why\" and less on \"what\".\n- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.\n- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running `git status`.\n- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked to do so.\n- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by the user.\n\n\n# Examples (Illustrating Tone and Workflow)\n<example>\nuser: 1 + 2\nmodel: 3\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 13 a prime number?\nmodel: true\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: start the server implemented in server.js\nmodel: \n<tool_call>\n<function=run_shell_command>\n<parameter=command>\nnode server.js &\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Refactor the auth logic in src/auth.py to use the requests library instead of urllib.\nmodel: Okay, I can refactor 'src/auth.py'.\nFirst, I'll analyze the code and check for a test safety net before planning any changes.\n<tool_call>\n<function=glob>\n<parameter=path>\ntests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n<function=read_file>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/tests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n<parameter=offset>\n0\n</parameter>\n<parameter=limit>\n10\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(After analysis)\nGreat, 'tests/test_auth.py' exists and covers the core authentication logic.

Which one would you like to start with, or should I read all of them?\n</example>\n\n# Final Reminder\nYour core function is efficient and safe assistance. Balance extreme conciseness with the crucial need for clarity, especially regarding safety and potential system modifications. Always prioritize user control and project conventions. Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use 'read_file' or 'read_many_files' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions. Finally, you are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved.",

Moved the `users` directory from `app/users` to `app/dashboard/users`\n\nNow these pages will automatically use the dashboard layout (with Navbar, Sidebar, and main content area) because they are nested inside the dashboard folder which contains the dashboard layout.tsx file.\n\nWith this structure:\n- `/dashboard` - Shows the main dashboard page with the dashboard layout\n- `/dashboard/settings` - Shows the settings page with the dashboard layout\n- `/dashboard/unit-kost` - Shows the unit-kost page with the dashboard layout\n- `/dashboard/users` - Shows the users page with the dashboard layout\n\nThe pages retain all their original functionality and styling, but now they're properly integrated into the dashboard layout system as requested."

Reduced the grid spacing from `spacing={3}` to `spacing={2}` to decrease the space between cards\n2. Changed the grid sizing to be more responsive and compact:\n   - Changed from `size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4, lg: 2.4 }}` to `size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 6, lg: 4, xl: 2.4 }}`\n   - This means on medium screens (md) the cards will take up half the width instead of a third, and on large screens (lg) they will take up 1/3 width instead of 2.4/12\n   - On extra large screens (xl) they maintain the 2.4/12 width for maximum density\n3. Reduced the RevenueChart container padding from `p: 3` to `p: 2` and added `mt: 2` for better spacing\n\nThese changes will allow more dashboard components to be visible on the screen at once while maintaining readability and responsive design. The layout will now be more compact on smaller screens while still showing more items on larger screens."

Berikut adalah ringkasan pekerjaan yang telah saya lakukan:\n\n1. **Membuat folder komponen baru**: Saya membuat folder `DashboardCards` dalam direktori `app/dashboard/components` untuk mengorganisasi komponen-komponen baru.\n\n2. **Membuat 4 komponen baru**:\n   - `RecentTransactionsCard`: Menampilkan transaksi-transaksi terbaru dari penghuni kost\n   - `OccupancyRateCard`: Menampilkan tingkat okupansi kost secara visual dengan progress bar\n   - `UpcomingRentCard`: Menampilkan daftar pembayaran sewa yang akan datang\n   - `QuickActionsCard`: Menyediakan tombol aksi cepat untuk tugas-tugas administratif\n\n3. **Memperbarui halaman dashboard**:\n   - Menyertakan semua komponen baru ke dalam layout halaman\n   - Mengatur layout responsif dengan grid yang optimal\n   - Menambahkan data contoh untuk mengilustrasikan fungsionalitas\n   - Memastikan semua komponen menggunakan desain yang sederhana namun profesional\n\nSemua komponen dibuat dengan pendekatan reusable React, sehingga kode tetap bersih dan tidak menumpuk di satu halaman. Struktur folder yang saya buat memudahkan pengelolaan komponen dan memungkinkan pengembangan di masa depan.\n\nDashboard kini menampilkan informasi yang lebih lengkap untuk manajemen kost, termasuk data keuangan, okupansi, transaksi, dan akses cepat ke fungsi administratif."

Saya telah membuat OccupancyRateCard lebih modern dengan beberapa peningkatan utama:\n\n1. **Desain Visual yang Lebih Modern**:\n   - Mengganti LinearProgress dengan ring progress menggunakan SVG\n   - Warna yang dinamis berdasarkan tingkat okupansi (hijau untuk tinggi, oranye untuk sedang, merah untuk rendah)\n   - Gradasi latar belakang card untuk tampilan yang lebih menarik\n   - Efek bayangan yang lembut\n\n2. **Interaktif dan Informatif**:\n   - Animasi untuk perubahan progress\n   - Komentar otomatis berdasarkan tingkat okupansi\n   - Warna yang berubah secara responsif\n\n3. **Tata Letak yang Lebih Seimbang**:\n   - Ring progress di tengah card\n   - Statistik berupa angka dalam format ringkas\n   - Informasi tambahan dalam bentuk pesan yang disesuaikan\n\n4. **Penggunaan Material UI secara Efektif**:\n   - Avatar dengan warna dinamis\n   - Tipografi yang jelas dan terstruktur\n   - Stack dan Box untuk tata letak yang fleksibel\n\nPerubahan ini membuat komponen lebih menarik secara visual dan memberikan informasi lebih kaya tentang status okupansi kost."

Sekarang komponen-komponen ini akan bekerja tanpa menyebabkan error hydrasi di lingkungan Next.js."

Berikut adalah perubahan yang saya lakukan:\n\n1. **Di RecentTransactionsCard**:\n   - Mengganti `ListItemText` dengan `Box` untuk menghindari konflik antara elemen `<p>` dan `<div>`\n   - Menggunakan struktur layout kustom yang lebih kontrol penuh atas elemen yang ditampilkan\n\n2. **Di UpcomingRentCard**:\n   - Sama seperti sebelumnya, mengganti `ListItemText` dengan `Box`\n   - Ini memastikan bahwa tidak ada elemen `<div>` yang secara tidak sengaja ditempatkan sebagai turunan dari elemen `<p>` buatan Material UI\n\nSolusi ini menghindari error hydrasi yang terjadi karena perbedaan antara markup server-side dan client-side. Dengan mengganti ListItemText (yang membungkus secondary text dalam elemen `<p>`) dengan Box (yang menggunakan elemen `<div>`), kita menghilangkan konflik struktur HTML yang menyebabkan error tersebut."

RevenueChart.tsx\n- Menambahkan gradasi latar belakang yang senada dengan komponen lain\n- Meningkatkan tampilan tombol toggle untuk periode mingguan/bulanan\n- Menyesuaikan tampilan dengan skema warna yang konsisten\n\n### 2. StatCard.tsx\n- Menyesuaikan desain card dengan gradasi latar belakang yang sama\n- Menambahkan efek hover untuk meningkatkan interaktivitas\n- Memperbarui warna avatar dan teks untuk konsistensi\n- Mengubah border radius dan efek bayangan agar serasi dengan komponen lain\n\n### 3. AddDataCard.tsx\n- Mengubah gradasi latar belakang agar sesuai dengan tema keseluruhan\n- Menyesuaikan border radius untuk konsistensi\n- Menambahkan efek hover untuk konsistensi pengalaman pengguna\n- Mengganti warna ikon dan meningkatkan ukuran untuk visibilitas yang lebih baik\n- Mengganti teks dari \"Add Data\" menjadi \"Tambah Data\" untuk konsistensi dengan bahasa Indonesia\n\nDengan perubahan ini, semua komponen kini memiliki tampilan dan nuansa yang serasi, memberikan pengalaman pengguna yang lebih konsisten dan profesional. Setiap komponen memiliki:\n- Gradasi latar belakang yang lembut (linear gradient dari #f5f7fa ke #e4edf9)\n- Efek hover yang seragam (naik sedikit dan bayangan meningkat)\n- Border radius yang konsisten\n- Warna dan tipografi yang harmonis"

Berikut adalah perubahan yang telah saya terapkan:\n\n### Desain Modern & Simple:\n- Mengganti background card dari gradasi menjadi putih murni (`bgcolor: \"white\"`)\n- Menambahkan border yang halus (`border: \"1px solid\"` dengan `borderColor: \"divider\"`)\n- Mengurangi radius sudut dari default ke `borderRadius: 2` untuk tampilan yang lebih modern\n\n### Informasi Mudah Dibaca:\n- Menggunakan warna yang lebih kontras untuk teks statistik (`primary.main`, `error.main`)\n- Mengganti ukuran font dari `caption` ke `body2` untuk pesan status, membuatnya lebih mudah dibaca\n- Mengurangi spacing antar elemen dari 3 ke 2 untuk tampilan yang lebih rapat dan terorganisir\n\n### Tampilan Visual:\n- Menjaga ring progress yang menarik namun tetap mudah dipahami\n- Menggunakan warna latar avatar yang konsisten dengan warna utama (dengan opacity)\n- Mempertahankan animasi transisi untuk pengalaman visual yang halus\n\nSekarang card memiliki latar belakang putih cerah, desain yang lebih modern, dan informasi yang lebih mudah dibaca dengan hierarki visual yang jelas."

Header yang jelas di bagian atas\n2. Baris pertama dengan 4 StatCard dan 1 AddDataCard yang seimbang\n3. Baris kedua dengan OccupancyRateCard dan QuickActionsCard dalam pembagian 6-6\n4. Baris ketiga dengan RecentTransactionsCard dan UpcomingRentCard dalam pembagian 6-6\n5. Grafik pendapatan di bagian paling bawah\n\nSemua komponen sekarang menggunakan desain yang konsisten, dengan ukuran yang proporsional dan tata letak yang rapi untuk pengalaman pengguna yang lebih baik."

            "text": "Saya telah berhasil merombak tata letak dashboard menjadi seperti bento box yang lebih menarik dan padat. Berikut adalah perubahan yang telah saya terapkan:\n\n### Desain Bento Box Baru:\n\n1. **Grid yang Lebih Padat**:\n   - Mengurangi spacing dari 2 ke 1.5 untuk tampilan yang lebih dekat dan padat\n   - Menata komponen-komponen dalam grid yang saling berdekatan\n\n2. **Tata Letak Responsif**:\n   - Menggunakan perpaduan ukuran grid yang berbeda untuk berbagai ukuran layar\n   - Pada layar besar (lg): beberapa komponen disusun secara bento box seperti (4, 4, 4), (3, 3, 3, 3), dll\n   - Pada layar kecil (xs): semua komponen menjadi full width untuk keterbacaan\n\n3. **Struktur Bento Box**:\n   - Statistik pendapatan dan pengguna disusun berdampingan (4, 4)\n   - Statistik laundry dan unit kosong disusun vertikal (2 baris dalam 4 lebar)\n   - Add Data Card, Okupansi, Aksi Cepat, dan Transaksi Terbaru disusun dalam grid 3 kolom\n   - UpcomingRentCard diperbesar ke 6 kolom (setengah lebar layar) untuk menyesuaikan kontennya\n   - RevenueChart diambil full width (12 kolom) sebagai elemen utama di bagian bawah\n\n4. **Keseimbangan Visual**:\n   - Menjaga proporsi antara elemen besar dan kecil\n   - Memastikan semua informasi penting tetap terlihat\n   - Menggunakan pembagian ruang yang lebih efisien\n\nDesain baru ini memberikan tampilan yang lebih modern dan menarik seperti bento box, dengan elemen-elemen yang berdekatan namun tetap rapi dan mudah dipahami. Pengguna dapat dengan mudah memindai informasi penting dari berbagai bagian dashboard secara visual."

Berikut adalah perubahan yang telah saya terapkan:\n\n### Perbaikan Desain Bento Box:\n\n1. **Penyesuaian Ukuran Komponen**:\n   - Mengurangi padding dari 2 ke 1.5 untuk tampilan yang lebih padat\n   - Mengurangi ukuran judul header dari h4 ke h5\n   - Menyesuaikan ukuran grid untuk setiap komponen agar lebih proporsional\n\n2. **Distribusi Ukuran yang Seimbang**:\n   - Statistik Pendapatan & Pengguna: ukuran sedang (3 dari 12 kolom pada layar lg)\n   - Statistik Laundry & Unit Kosong: ukuran kecil (2 dari 12 kolom pada layar lg) \n   - Aksi Cepat & Okupansi: ukuran sedang (3 dari 12 kolom pada layar lg)\n   - Add Data Card: ukuran kecil (2 dari 12 kolom pada layar lg)\n   - Recent Transactions: ukuran sedang (4 dari 12 kolom pada layar lg)\n   - Upcoming Rent Card: ukuran lebih besar (6 dari 12 kolom pada layar lg)\n   - Revenue Chart: ukuran penuh (12 dari 12 kolom)\n\n3. **Responsif**:\n   - Menggunakan grid yang berbeda untuk ukuran layar yang berbeda (xs, sm, md, lg)\n   - Menyesuaikan tampilan untuk berbagai ukuran layar\n\n4. **Visual yang Lebih Rapi**:\n   - Mengurangi margin antar elemen\n   - Memastikan tidak ada elemen yang terlalu dominan\n   - Menyeimbangkan ukuran antara komponen-komponen besar dan kecil\n\nDengan perubahan ini, dashboard sekarang memiliki tampilan bento box yang lebih seimbang, di mana tidak ada elemen yang terlalu besar atau kecil, dan semua informasi penting tetap terlihat dengan baik. Tampilan menjadi lebih kompak dan estetik secara visual."

Tampilan ini membuat card ini menjadi fokus utama dalam informasi operasional bisnis kost."

The columns can be configured with multiple breakpoints to specify the column span of each child.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe grid system is implemented with the Grid component:\n\nIt uses CSS Flexbox (rather than CSS Grid) for high flexibility.\nThe grid is always a flex item. Use the container prop to add a flex container.\nItem widths are set in percentages, so they're always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.\nThere are five default grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl. If you need custom breakpoints, check out custom breakpoints grid.\nYou can give integer values for each breakpoint, to indicate how many of the 12 available columns are occupied by the component when the viewport width satisfies the breakpoint constraints.\nIt uses the gap CSS property to add spacing between items.\nIt does not support row spanning. Children elements cannot span multiple rows. We recommend using CSS Grid if you need this functionality.\nIt does not automatically place children. It will try to fit the children one by one, and if there is not enough space, the rest of the children will start on the next line, and so on. If you need auto-placement, we recommend using CSS Grid instead.\nThe Grid component is a layout grid, not a data grid. If you need a data grid, check out the MUI X DataGrid component.\n\nFluid grids\n\nFluid grids use columns that scale and resize content. A fluid grid's layout can use breakpoints to determine if the layout needs to change dramatically.\n\nBasic grid\n\nIn order to create a grid layout, you need a container. Use the container prop to create a grid container that wraps the grid items (the Grid is always an item).\n\nColumn widths are integer values between 1 and 12. For example, an item with size={6} occupies half of the grid container's width.\n\nsize=8\nsize=4\nsize=4\nsize=8\nimport { styled } from ' @mui/material/styles';\nimport Box from ' @mui/material/Box';\nimport Paper from ' @mui/material/Paper';\nimport Grid from ' @mui/material/Grid';\n\nconst Item = styled(Paper)(({ theme }) => ({\n  backgroundColor: '#fff',\n  ...theme.typography.body2,\n  padding: theme.spacing(1),\n  textAlign: 'center',\n  color: (theme.vars ?? theme).palette.text.secondary,\n  ...theme.applyStyles('dark', {\n    backgroundColor: '#1A2027',\n  }),\n}));\n\nexport default function BasicGrid() {\n  return (\n    <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n      <Grid container spacing={2}>\n        <Grid size={8}>\n          <Item>size=8</Item>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid size={4}>\n          <Item>size=4</Item>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid size={4}>\n          <Item>size=4</Item>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid size={8}>\n          <Item>size=8</Item>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );\n}\nimport { styled } from ' @mui/material/styles';\nimport Box from ' @mui/material/Box';\nimport Paper from ' @mui/material/Paper';\nimport Grid from ' @mui/material/Grid';\n\nconst Item = styled(Paper)(({ theme }) => ({\n  backgroundColor: '#fff',\n  ...theme.typography.body2,\n  padding: theme.spacing(1),\n  textAlign: 'center',\n  color: (theme.vars ?? theme).palette.text.secondary,\n  ...theme.applyStyles('dark', {\n    backgroundColor: '#1A2027',\n  }),\n}));\n\nexport default function BasicGrid() {\n  return (\n    <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n      <Grid container spacing={2}>\n        <Grid size={8}>\n          <Item>size=8</Item>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid size={4}>\n          <Item>size=4</Item>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid size={4}>\n          <Item>size=4</Item>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid size={8}>\n          <Item>size=8</Item>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    </Box>\n  );\n}\nPress Enter to start editing\nMultiple breakpoints\n\nItems may have multiple widths defined, causing the layout to change at the defined breakpoint. Width values apply to all wider breakpoints, and larger breakpoints override those given to smaller breakpoints.\n\nFor example, a component with size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6 }} occupies the entire viewport width when the viewport is less than 600 pixels wide. When the viewport grows beyond this size, the component occupies half of the total width—six columns rather than 12.\n\nxs=6 md=8\nxs=6 md=4\nxs=6 md=4\nxs=6 md=8\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 8 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 4 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 4 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 8 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 8 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 4 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 4 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 8 }}>\n    <Item>xs=6 md=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nSpacing\n\nUse the spacing prop to control the space between children. The spacing value can be any positive number (including decimals) or a string. The prop is converted into a CSS property using the theme.spacing() helper.\n\nThe following demo illustrates the use of the spacing prop:\n\nspacing\n0\n0.5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n8\n12\nCopy\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\nRow and column spacing\n\nThe rowSpacing and columnSpacing props let you specify row and column gaps independently of one another. They behave similarly to the row-gap and column-gap properties of CSS Grid.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n<Grid container rowSpacing={1} columnSpacing={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 3 }}>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>1</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>2</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>3</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container rowSpacing={1} columnSpacing={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 3 }}>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>1</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>2</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>3</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nResponsive values\n\nYou can set prop values to change when a given breakpoint is active. For instance, we can implement Material Design's recommended responsive layout grid, as seen in the following demo:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n<Grid container spacing={{ xs: 2, md: 3 }} columns={{ xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 12 }}>\n  {Array.from(Array(6)).map((_, index) => (\n    <Grid key={index} size={{ xs: 2, sm: 4, md: 4 }}>\n      <Item>{index + 1}</Item>\n    </Grid>\n  ))}\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={{ xs: 2, md: 3 }} columns={{ xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 12 }}>\n  {Array.from(Array(6)).map((_, index) => (\n    <Grid key={index} size={{ xs: 2, sm: 4, md: 4 }}>\n      <Item>{index + 1}</Item>\n    </Grid>\n  ))}\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nResponsive values are supported by:\n\nsize\ncolumns\ncolumnSpacing\ndirection\nrowSpacing\nspacing\noffset\nInteractive\n\nBelow is an interactive demo that lets you explore the visual results of the different settings:\n\nCell 1\nCell 2\nCell 3\ndirection\nrow\nrow-reverse\njustifyContent\nflex-start\ncenter\nflex-end\nspace-between\nspace-around\nspace-evenly\nalignItems\nflex-start\ncenter\nflex-end\nstretch\nbaseline\nCopy\n<Grid\n  container\n  direction=\"row\"\n  sx={{\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n  }}\n>\nAuto-layout\n\nThe auto-layout feature gives equal space to all items present. When you set the width of one item, the others will automatically resize to match it.\n\nsize=grow\nsize=6\nsize=grow\n<Grid container spacing={3}>\n  <Grid size=\"grow\">\n    <Item>size=grow</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>size=6</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size=\"grow\">\n    <Item>size=grow</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={3}>\n  <Grid size=\"grow\">\n    <Item>size=grow</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>size=6</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size=\"grow\">\n    <Item>size=grow</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nVariable width content\n\nWhen a breakpoint's value is given as \"auto\", then a column's size will automatically adjust to match the width of its content. The demo below shows how this works:\n\nsize=auto\nsize=6\nsize=grow\n<Grid container spacing={3}>\n  <Grid size=\"auto\">\n    <Item>size=auto</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>size=6</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size=\"grow\">\n    <Item>size=grow</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={3}>\n  <Grid size=\"auto\">\n    <Item>size=auto</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={6}>\n    <Item>size=6</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size=\"grow\">\n    <Item>size=grow</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nNested grid\n\nThe grid container that renders as a direct child inside another grid container is a nested grid that inherits its columns and spacing from the top level. It will also inherit the props of the top-level grid if it receives those props.\n\nNote that a nested grid container should be a direct child of another grid container. If there are non-grid elements in between, the grid container will start as the new root container.\n\n<Grid container>\n  <Grid container> // A nested grid container that inherits columns and spacing from above.\n    <div>\n      <Grid container> // A new root grid container with its own variables scope.\n\nCopy\nInheriting spacing\n\nA nested grid container inherits the row and column spacing from its parent unless the spacing prop is specified to the instance.\n\nEmail subscribe section\nCategory A\nLink 1.1\nLink 1.2\nLink 1.3\nCategory B\nLink 2.1\nLink 2.2\nLink 2.3\nCategory C\nLink 3.1\nLink 3.2\nLink 3.3\nCategory D\nLink 4.1\nLink 4.2\nLink 4.3\n© Copyright\nLink A\nLink B\nLink C\nInheriting columns\n\nA nested grid container inherits the columns from its parent unless the columns prop is specified to the instance.\n\nsize=8/24\nnested size=12/24\nnested size=12/24\nsize=8/24\nnested size=6/12\nnested size=6/12\nColumns\n\nUse the columns prop to change the default number of columns (12) in the grid, as shown below:\n\nsize=8\nsize=8\n<Grid container spacing={2} columns={16}>\n  <Grid size={8}>\n    <Item>size=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={8}>\n    <Item>size=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={2} columns={16}>\n  <Grid size={8}>\n    <Item>size=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={8}>\n    <Item>size=8</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nOffset\n\nThe offset prop pushes an item to the right side of the grid. This props accepts:\n\nnumbers—for example, offset={{ md: 2 }} pushes an item two columns to the right when the viewport size is equal to or greater than the md breakpoint.\n\"auto\"—this pushes the item to the far right side of the grid container.\nThe demo below illustrates how to use the offset props:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n<Grid container spacing={3} sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 2 }} offset={{ xs: 3, md: 0 }}>\n    <Item>1</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 4, md: 2 }} offset={{ md: 'auto' }}>\n    <Item>2</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 4, md: 2 }} offset={{ xs: 4, md: 0 }}>\n    <Item>3</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 'grow', md: 6 }} offset={{ md: 2 }}>\n    <Item>4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={3} sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 2 }} offset={{ xs: 3, md: 0 }}>\n    <Item>1</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 4, md: 2 }} offset={{ md: 'auto' }}>\n    <Item>2</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 4, md: 2 }} offset={{ xs: 4, md: 0 }}>\n    <Item>3</Item>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={{ xs: 'grow', md: 6 }} offset={{ md: 2 }}>\n    <Item>4</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nCustom breakpoints\n\nIf you specify custom breakpoints in the theme, you can use those names as grid item props in responsive values:\n\nimport { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from ' @mui/material/styles';\n\nfunction Demo() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeProvider\n      theme={createTheme({\n        breakpoints: {\n          values: {\n            laptop: 1024,\n            tablet: 640,\n            mobile: 0,\n            desktop: 1280,\n          },\n        },\n      })}\n    >\n      <Grid container spacing={{ mobile: 1, tablet: 2, laptop: 3 }}>\n        {Array.from(Array(4)).map((_, index) => (\n          <Grid key={index} size={{ mobile: 6, tablet: 4, laptop: 3 }}>\n            <div>{index + 1}</div>\n          </Grid>\n        ))}\n      </Grid>\n    </ThemeProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nCopy\nCustom breakpoints affect all responsive values.\n\nTypeScript\n\nYou have to set module augmentation on the theme breakpoints interface.\n\ndeclare module ' @mui/system' {\n  interface BreakpointOverrides {\n    // Your custom breakpoints\n    laptop: true;\n    tablet: true;\n    mobile: true;\n    desktop: true;\n    // Remove default breakpoints\n    xs: false;\n    sm: false;\n    md: false;\n    lg: false;\n    xl: false;\n  }\n}\n\nCopy\nCustomization\n\nCentered elements\n\nTo center a grid item's content, specify display=\"flex\" directly on the item. Then use justifyContent and/or alignItems to adjust the position of the content, as shown below:\n\n<Grid container spacing={2} minHeight={160}>\n  <Grid display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"center\" alignItems=\"center\" size=\"grow\">\n    <Avatar src=\"/static/images/avatar/1.jpg\" />\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"center\" alignItems=\"center\">\n    <Avatar src=\"/static/images/avatar/2.jpg\" />\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"center\" alignItems=\"center\" size=\"grow\">\n    <Avatar src=\"/static/images/avatar/3.jpg\" />\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={2} minHeight={160}>\n  <Grid display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"center\" alignItems=\"center\" size=\"grow\">\n    <Avatar src=\"/static/images/avatar/1.jpg\" />\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"center\" alignItems=\"center\">\n    <Avatar src=\"/static/images/avatar/2.jpg\" />\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"center\" alignItems=\"center\" size=\"grow\">\n    <Avatar src=\"/static/images/avatar/3.jpg\" />\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nUsing the container prop does not work in this situation because the grid container is designed exclusively to wrap grid items. It cannot wrap other elements.\n\nFull border\n\nHalf border\n\nLimitations\n\nColumn direction\n\nUsing direction=\"column\" or direction=\"column-reverse\" is not supported. The Grid component is specifically designed to subdivide a layout into columns, not rows. You should not use the Grid component on its own to stack layout elements vertically. Instead, you should use the Stack component inside of a Grid to create vertical layouts as shown below:\n\nColumn 1 - Row 1\nColumn 1 - Row 2\nColumn 1 - Row 3\nColumn 2\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid size={4}>\n    <Stack spacing={2}>\n      <Item>Column 1 - Row 1</Item>\n      <Item>Column 1 - Row 2</Item>\n      <Item>Column 1 - Row 3</Item>\n    </Stack>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={8}>\n    <Item sx={{ height: '100%', boxSizing: 'border-box' }}>Column 2</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid size={4}>\n    <Stack spacing={2}>\n      <Item>Column 1 - Row 1</Item>\n      <Item>Column 1 - Row 2</Item>\n      <Item>Column 1 - Row 3</Item>\n    </Stack>\n  </Grid>\n  <Grid size={8}>\n    <Item sx={{ height: '100%', boxSizing: 'border-box' }}>Column 2</Item>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\nPress Enter to start editing\nAPI\n\nSee the documentation below for a complete reference to all of the props and classes available to the components mentioned here.\n\n<Grid />\n<PigmentGrid />\nWas this page helpful?\n\n•\n\nBlog\n•\n\nStore\nContents\n\nHow it works\nFluid grids\nBasic grid\nMultiple breakpoints\nSpacing\nRow and column spacing\nResponsive values\nInteractive\nAuto-layout\nVariable width content\nNested grid\nInheriting spacing\nInheriting columns\nColumns\nOffset\nCustom breakpoints\nTypeScript\nCustomization\nCentered elements\nFull border\nHalf border\nLimitations\nColumn direction\nAPI\ndoit\nkombai\nBecome a Diamond sponsor\nMUI stands in solidarity with Ukraine.\nReact Grid component - Material UI"

Berikut adalah perubahan yang telah saya lakukan:\n\n### Perbaikan pada QuickActionsCard.tsx:\n- Mengganti `xs={6}` menjadi `size={{ xs: 6 }}` sesuai dengan dokumentasi terbaru Material UI\n- Struktur sekarang mengikuti pola yang benar: `size={{ xs: 6 }}` untuk menentukan lebar kolom responsif\n\nDengan perbaikan ini, komponen sekarang menggunakan properti yang benar sesuai dengan dokumentasi Material UI Grid, di mana `size` menggantikan penggunaan `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, dan `xl` secara terpisah. Setiap item sekarang menempati setengah dari lebar container (6 dari 12 kolom) pada semua ukuran layar, yang membuat tampilan grid menjadi konsisten dan responsif."

Berikut adalah perubahan yang telah saya terapkan:\n\n### Tampilan List Baru:\n- Mengganti struktur Grid dengan komponen List dari Material UI\n- Setiap aksi sekarang ditampilkan sebagai item dalam list vertikal\n- Menggunakan ListItem, ListItemButton, ListItemIcon, dan ListItemText untuk struktur yang rapi\n- Menjaga ikon dan warna untuk setiap aksi\n- Menambahkan efek hover yang halus (bergeser ke kanan dan bayangan meningkat)\n- Menggunakan border pada setiap item untuk memisahkan secara visual\n- Mengurangi margin antar item untuk tampilan yang lebih padat\n\n### Tampilan Visual:\n- Setiap aksi muncul sebagai baris horizontal dengan ikon avatar dan teks judul\n- Warna ikon konsisten dengan fungsi masing-masing aksi\n- Padding dan ukuran teks disesuaikan untuk keterbacaan yang lebih baik\n- Efek hover yang elegan tanpa animasi yang berlebihan\n- Desain yang lebih minimalis dan profesional\n\n### Fungsionalitas:\n- Setiap ListItemButton tetap memiliki onClick handler untuk aksi\n- Struktur data tetap sama sehingga tidak ada perubahan fungsionalitas\n- Responsif dan bekerja di berbagai ukuran layar\n\nDesain baru ini lebih profesional dan mengikuti prinsip desain material, dengan struktur informasi yang lebih jelas dan hierarki visual yang lebih baik."

Berikut adalah perubahan yang telah saya terapkan:\n\n### Perbaikan Tata Letak (Bento Box Design):\n1. **Mengurangi Spacing**: Mengurangi spacing dari 1.5 ke 1 untuk tampilan yang lebih rapat\n2. **Menyesuaikan Margin**: Mengurangi margin dari 1.5 ke 1 untuk header dan grid\n3. **Mengatur Grid Lebih Seimbang**:\n   - Baris pertama: Mengatur konsistensi ukuran grid untuk StatCard dan AddDataCard\n   - Baris kedua: Menggabungkan OccupancyRateCard dan QuickActionsCard secara seimbang\n   - Baris ketiga: Menyamakan ukuran RecentTransactionsCard dan UpcomingRentCard\n\n4. **Penataan yang Lebih Rapi**:\n   - Semua StatCard memiliki ukuran yang lebih konsisten (3, 3, 2, 2, 2)\n   - Card berukuran besar (Occupancy, QuickActions, Recent, Upcoming) memiliki ukuran 6-6 pada layar besar\n   - Pengelompokan logis untuk setiap jenis informasi\n\n### Hasil Akhir:\n- Tampilan bento box yang lebih rapi dan konsisten\n- Pengelompokan informasi yang logis dan seimbang\n- Spacing yang lebih padat untuk tampilan yang terintegrasi dengan baik\n- Tata letak responsive yang tetap bekerja di berbagai ukuran layar\n\nDashboard sekarang memiliki tampilan bento box yang lebih profesional dengan komponen-komponen yang menempel dengan rapi dan konsisten satu sama lain."

For these explicitly requested non-text files, their data is read and included in a format suitable for model consumption (e.g., base64 encoded).\n\nThis tool is useful when you need to understand or analyze a collection of files, such as:\n- Getting an overview of a codebase or parts of it (e.g., all TypeScript files in the 'src' directory).\n- Finding where specific functionality is implemented if the user asks broad questions about code.\n- Reviewing documentation files (e.g., all Markdown files in the 'docs' directory).\n- Gathering context from multiple configuration files.\n- When the user asks to \"read all files in X directory\" or \"show me the content of all Y files\".\n\nUse this tool when the user's query implies needing the content of several files simultaneously for context, analysis, or summarization. For text files, it uses default UTF-8 encoding and a '--- {filePath} ---' separator between file contents. The tool inserts a '--- End of content ---' after the last file. Ensure paths are relative to the target directory. Glob patterns like 'src/**/*.js' are supported. Avoid using for single files if a more specific single-file reading tool is available, unless the user specifically requests to process a list containing just one file via this tool.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n",
